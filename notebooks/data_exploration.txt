ABSTRACT
I sourced some Amazon review information from Kaggle and found these two promising datasets, there are pros and cons to each which are weighed below.

DATASETS
amazon.csv - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset
amazon_reviews_vs_ratings.csv - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews
Amazon-Products.csv - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/amazon-products-dataset

CONCLUSION
Amazon-Products.csv would be the best csv to use for our project. There is enough data to form strong prediction models, there are enough classes for us
to inventively compare and predict different factors of the products and the data is not already perfectly formatted, ensuring that we can also show off
our data cleaning skills. The only shame is that there isn't any further data about Amazon sellers, locations or product journey, but still plenty enough 
here to form a project. And we may reveal more as we explore the text based product names, for example: brand names may be present inside the product name.

EXPLORATION

AMAZON.CSV
The data exploration is located in the amazon_csv_exploration.ipynb file (Jupyter notebnook, python 3.11.4)
The exploration reveals the dataset has 1465 records, of which none are duplicated. There are 114 (10%) duplicated product IDs.
The dataset has 16 columns including relevant columns: category, discount_percentage, rating, rating_count, user_name, review_title, review_content.

The variety of data could be used for features or targets, where multiple operations  can be performed. review_title and review_content are obvious 
feature choices and we could use these to classify and predict ratings. we could also compare ratings with items like discount percentage and 
category to spot trends and see how much the review content correlates with those patterns. e.g. if we notice a stronger correlation between 
discount price and reviews, do we reimagine the importance of reviews. customer_name and rating number are included to allow us to rule out potential
fake accounts or items with low review numbers.

PROS
Lost of columns for varied analysis
Data is very clean

CONS
dataset is a little short and a small sample of less than 2000 reviews may not be strong enough to accurately make predictions.
No data on manufacturing process, shipping location or even Amazon sellers

AMAZON_REVIEWS_VS_RATINGS.CSV
The data exploration is located in the amazon_reviews_vs_ratings_csv_exploration.ipynb file (Jupyter notebnook, python 3.11.4)
The data exploration reveals that the dataset has 3,650,000 records, none of which are duplicated.
The data has 3 columns: star_rating, short_review, long_review.
short_review has 214 NaN values and brief exploration reviewd more potential NaNs behind hidden characters.
With this data we could compare reviews with star ratings and predict ratings.

ORIGIN

Sourced from kaggle.com - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews, train.csv and test.csv, must be concatenated.

The Amazon reviews dataset consists of reviews from amazon. The data span a period of 18 years, including ~35 million reviews up to March 2013. Reviews 
include product and user information, ratings, and a plaintext review. For more information, please refer to the following paper: J. McAuley and 
J. Leskovec. Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text. RecSys, 2013.

The Amazon reviews full score dataset is constructed by Xiang Zhang (xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the above dataset. It is used as a text classification 
benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. 
Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).

PROS
Very strong dataset with lots of records to form strong models

CONS
Very limited dataset, only useful for comparing reviews and ratings.

AMAZON-PRODUCTS.CSV
The data exploration is located in the amazon_products_csv_exploration.ipynb file (Jupyter notebnook, python 3.11.4)
The data exploration reveals that the dataset has 551,585 records, none of which are duplicated.
The data has 9 columns: 'name', 'main_category', 'sub_category', 'image', 'link', 'ratings', 'no_of_ratings', 'discount_price', 'actual_price'
4 of the columns have large numbers of NaN values, all columns are of type object.
With this data we could compare reviews with star ratings and predict ratings.

PROS
Very strong dataset with lots of records to form strong models
Lots of columns for cross examination and further analyses.
Some Data cleaning required in NaN and bad dtypes.

CONS
No data on manufacturing process, shipping location or even Amazon sellers
